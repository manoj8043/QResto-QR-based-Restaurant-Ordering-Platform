Professional Project Development Plan (SaaS-Ready)
Instead of just “stages → tasks,” this approach uses Product Development Lifecycle + Modular Architecture so the project is scalable, maintainable, and team-friendly.

Phase 0 — Discovery & Planning
Goal: Avoid rewriting later by defining architecture, roles, and tech stack early.

Tasks:
Requirements Gathering

Define features for MVP vs. future (loyalty points, multi-restaurant, payments, analytics)

Identify user personas: Restaurant Admin, Customer

Technical Architecture

Choose stack:

Frontend: React (Customer) + React (Admin) (could be monorepo or separate repos)

Backend: Node.js (Express or NestJS)

DB: MongoDB (flexible schema for menu items/orders)

Auth: JWT for admins, OTP for customers

Hosting: Vercel (frontend), Render/Heroku/AWS (backend)

System Diagram

ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram)

API design (endpoints, payloads)

User flow diagrams

Version Control Setup

Git repo structure (monorepo or multi-repo)

Branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow: main, develop, feature branches)

Phase 1 — Foundation
Goal: Lay down the basic skeleton for all parts so they can grow independently.

Tasks:
Backend Setup

Folder structure:

csharp
Copy
Edit
backend/
  src/
    config/      # env, db config
    models/      # Mongoose schemas
    routes/      # API endpoints
    controllers/ # Business logic
    middlewares/ # Auth, error handling
    utils/       # Helpers
    app.js
API health check endpoint

MongoDB connection

Frontend Setup (Admin & Customer)

Separate React apps (or one monorepo with /apps/admin & /apps/customer)

Tailwind or Material UI

Routing skeleton

CI/CD Setup

GitHub Actions for automated build & deploy

Commit: "Initial backend & frontend scaffolding with CI/CD"

Phase 2 — Authentication & Authorization
Goal: Secure both apps before building features.

Tasks:
Admin: Email/password + JWT

Customer: Mobile number + OTP

Role-based access control (RBAC) in backend

Token storage (HTTP-only cookies or localStorage)

Commit: "Add authentication system for admin & customers with RBAC"

Phase 3 — Core Features
Goal: Implement main features for MVP.

For Admin App:
Menu CRUD

Order list + status updates

Restaurant info update

For Customer App:
QR → Table ID detection

OTP login

View menu, add to cart, checkout

Order status tracking

Commit: "Implement menu management, ordering system, and order tracking"

Phase 4 — Integration & Real-Time
Goal: Improve UX with live updates.

Tasks:
WebSockets for live order updates

Image uploads for menu items

Error handling & loading states

Commit: "Add real-time order updates and image uploads"

Phase 5 — Testing & Optimization
Goal: Ensure app is reliable before launch.

Tasks:
Unit tests (Jest)

API tests (Postman/Newman)

Performance audit (Lighthouse)

Security checks (Helmet, rate limiting)

Commit: "Add tests and optimize performance"

Phase 6 — Launch & Monitor
Goal: Deploy & monitor in production.

Tasks:
Deploy frontend (Vercel)

Deploy backend (Render/AWS)

Setup monitoring (Sentry, LogRocket)

Collect feedback for v2

Commit: "Deploy MVP to production"

Why This Is More Professional
Parallel Development: Backend & frontend can progress independently.

Clear Separation of Concerns: Admin UI and Customer UI are isolated for better performance and security.

Scalability: Monorepo + modular backend makes it easy to add features later.

Best Practices: Gitflow, CI/CD, testing, security, and documentation from the start.
